$text_rake = "Research from Demand Metric shows content marketing costs 62 percent less but produces three times as many leads as traditional marketing. This is no surprise when you realize 70 percent of people would prefer to learn about a company through an article rather than advertising. 

Content marketing can generate huge amounts of traffic, leads, and sales for your business. If you’re a company looking to get started with content marketing, this can be tough. 

The 8 Best Content Marketing Companies of 2020
What kind of content do your customers want from you? Is that the same kind of content that creates revenue for your business? Today we’ll take a look at the best content marketing companies in the industry. 

1. NP Digital – Best for Immediate and Consistent Revenue Growth

NP Digital is my content marketing company. Working with Mike Kamo, we created NP Digital to serve the millions of people who needed help with their content marketing. 

No matter which business I was working on — Kissmetrics, CrazyEgg, Quicksprout — there were always a ton of people reaching out to me, people who needed help with their advertising and content marketing campaigns. Long time readers on my site know that I focused on revenue. 

Rankings are important, but many marketers still focus obsessively on keywords and content that doesn’t lead to revenue. I’ve always focused on helping readers build a business that generates traffic, leads, and, most importantly, revenue. 

Another thing that’s different about NP Digital is the fact that we don’t separate technical SEO from content marketing. SEO — technical, on-page, off-page, local, etc. it’s always a package deal with content marketing. This means the content we create for our clients automatically performs well with Google, there’s no extra work required. 

NP Digital is my way of helping everyone achieve the revenue and growth they deserve in their business.

Google

It created a big query environment with 202 million SERP data records.

With Seer Interactive, their approach is SEO heavy. That should be an important priority for every company, whether you’re big or small, but not every company is ready for Big Data.

4 Characteristics that Make a Great Content Marketing Company
Your content marketing depends on several factors to be successful. A good content marketing company will provide you with all of these, and they’ll have no problem demonstrating that they have the expertise they need to make your campaign a success. 

Factor #1: A Stable Team of Content Creators
A healthy content marketing company will have a roster of regular and consistent writers on their team. Stable writers are skilled at writing, grammar, logical consistency, and storytelling. These writers can draw your readers in, creating content that moves people towards a specific goal or objective that you have in mind. 

These writers don’t need a lot of babysitting, and they’re able to figure things out, to a certain extent, on their own. They’re dependable, and they’re able to match your brand voice. 

Content mills produce poorly written filler content that’s mainly written for search engines. When you contact a content marketing company, you’ll want to ask them questions about how they run their business. 

How many writers do you have on staff?
Are they freelance or W-2? Do you use a mix of both? 
How many of your writers are full time? Part-time? 
How do you manage your team of writers? 
How many years of experience does the average writer on your team have? 
When you ask companies these questions listen to their answers carefully. Look for any inconsistencies or red flags. If you spot any red flags, bring them up immediately and ask for an answer. 

Factor #2: Access to Publishers and Influencers
According to Derek Halpern, founder of Social Triggers, you should be spending 20 percent of your time on content creation and 80 percent of your time on content promotion. The content marketing companies you work with are no different. If you’re investing a significant amount of time and money on creating an amazing piece of content, you should be spending 4x as much time on promotion. 

You want to make sure everyone in your target audience that needs to see the content you’ve created, sees it. 

When you’re working with a content marketing company, they should already have a list of influencers and publishers in their address book. They should also have connections and relationships with the right people, so they’re reasonably sure they can drive traffic to your content. 

Factor #3: Specialized Knowledge About your Industry
In an ideal world, your content marketing provider has a significant amount of experience in your space, or the ability to connect with experts who do. At a minimum, you’ll want to ensure that the content marketing company you choose can write credibly about the topics that are relevant to your business. 

The more specialized the content, the more important these criteria are for your business. 

Industries like healthcare, engineering, or finance require large amounts of specialized experience. It’s unrealistic to expect an inexperienced company to write credibly about a technical topic. On the other hand, there are some pros and cons that you’ll need to weigh for your business. 

Inexperienced Company Con: If you hire an inexperienced company, they’ll need more time to research and get up to speed. Content production will probably take more time than expected and will require more edits at first. 
Inexperienced Company Pro: they’ll bring new ideas that are perfect for beginners. Since they’re learning the space as they go, their writers will produce content that your audience also finds helpful. 
Experience Company Pro: If you hire an experienced company, they’ll produce content faster, and they’ll provide readers with a deeper level of insight that comes from years of experience. 
Specialization requires specialists. The more technical your business, the more important it is to have a specialist on hand. Mainstream content can do very well with generalists. 

Factor #4: Content Analysis and Measurement
You’ll need to see the numbers; your content marketing company should be able to provide you with a detailed breakdown. You should receive data outlining your performance; they should provide you with the KPIs, metrics, and sentiment surrounding your content.

You should be able to answer the following questions:

Does this content move us closer to our campaign goals? 
Does this piece of content (e.g., blog post, whitepaper, ebook, infographic), lead to a conversion?
How far are people reading into your content? 
Where in our flywheel are we losing customers? 
What do we need to change/optimize to improve our conversion rates?
Which content marketing opportunities are we missing, and where? 
Creating content isn’t enough. The content marketing company you choose should provide you with the actionable data you need to create profitable content for your business. 

What To Expect From a Great Content Marketing Company
A great content marketing company should be able to provide you with a consistent and comprehensive set of deliverables. These deliverables ensure that your content marketing campaigns stay on track and that you’re able to achieve the consistent results you need.

Your content marketing provider should provide you with deliverables throughout the pre-launch, launch, and post-launch phases of your campaign. 

Deliverables include: 

Content samples demonstrating your knowledge and expertise
The information and materials (e.g., credentials, existing content) they need from you to get started
A statement of work and a list of deliverables (e.g., 14, 2,500-word articles each mo., edits included)
Their process (if they’re not working with you and yours)
Projected campaign milestones, timelines, and calendars
Your point-of-contact including their name, and contact information
Hours of availability
The best way to communicate (e.g., Slack, email, phone, chat, or text)
Expectations from you 
Their process, policies, and procedures
Analysis and reports including business goals, objectives, KPIs, metrics, strategy, tactics, and risks
Content audits
Consistent updates on your campaign performance
Regular (weekly or monthly) calls to discuss performance
Consistently updated due dates and delivery timelines
Monthly debrief to discuss successes and failures
Here are some additional details you should also expect from your content marketing providers:

Good boundaries (including the ability to say no)
Prompt and clear feedback
Accurate information on various parts of your campaign including financial, campaign, and performance data
Great content marketing companies asked more questions in the beginning. They provide you with the upfront information you need to vet their company and make an informed decision. Once you’ve decided to move forward, they ask you for all of the information and materials they’ll need to produce the results you want.

Conclusion
Content marketing produces more leads and revenue than traditional marketing methods. If you’re looking for a good content marketing company to help you get started, it can be tough. Use this list to identify the companies that are a good fit for your business. 

With this post, you should have a pretty good idea of the questions to ask, what to expect, and how to select the right content marketing provider. 

Invest the right amount of effort with the right company, and your content marketing will grow faster than you expect. It’s tough in the beginning, but it will take effort, push through, and keep creating really helpful content, even if it’s hard. 

You’ll see consistent revenue growth once customers realize that you’re serious about helping them solve their problems. Content marketing is the best way to show them that you understand, and you can help. " ;
